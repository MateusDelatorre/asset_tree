# What would I do diferent
  * First thing should be study a little more GetX to make the architecture more clean, and comment the code for better readability
  * The next thing would be to render the tree more efficiently because the apex unit is taking too much time to load. Propably make the tree render 10 root node at start and 10 more every time the user scroll down
